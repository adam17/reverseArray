# reverseArray

Arrays have a _reverse_ method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, _reverseArray_ and _reverseArrayInPlace_. The first, _reverseArray_, takes an array as argument and produces a _new_ array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, _reverseArrayInPlace_, does what the _reverse_ method does: it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard _reverse_ method.

Which one runs faster?
